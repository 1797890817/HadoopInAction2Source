The code is hosted at http://github.com/tomwhite/hadoop-book/. You can find code
for the first edition at http://github.com/tomwhite/hadoop-book/tree/1e, and
for the second edition at http://github.com/tomwhite/hadoop-book/tree/2e.

This version of the code has been tested with:
 * Hadoop 1.1.1/0.22.0/0.23.0/2.0.2-alpha
 * Avro 1.5.4
 * Pig 0.9.1
 * Hive 0.8.0
 * HBase 0.90.4
 * ZooKeeper 3.4.2
 * Sqoop 1.4.0-incubating
 * MRUnit 0.8.0-incubating

Before running the examples you need to install Hadoop, Pig, Hive, HBase,
ZooKeeper, and Sqoop (as appropriate) as explained in the book.

You also need to install Maven.

Then you can build the code with:

% mvn package -DskipTests -Dhadoop.version=1.1.1

(Note that only the Hadoop version numbers specified in hadoop-meta/pom.xml
can be used here, not any version of Hadoop.)

You should then be able to run the examples from the book.
